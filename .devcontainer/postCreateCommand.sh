##### postCreateCommand.sh
#
# Purpose:
#
#   - Executes once after the container has been created and VS Code has attached for the very first time.
#
#   - Meant for one-time setup tasks in the container workspace,
#     for example installing dependencies or configuring project-specific settings that donâ€™t 
#     need to reoccur on subsequent container starts.
