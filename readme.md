# Devlite

**Devlite** is a simple, ready-to-go development environment. Just set **one** variable, open VS Code, and start codingâ€”**no manual setup required**.

## Features
- **Minimal Configuration:** Only one required setting.
- **Ubuntu-based DevContainer:** Optimized for development.
- **Preconfigured Stack:** PHP, Node.js, MariaDB, Redis.
- **VS Code Integration:** Just open the project folder, and DevContainers handle everything.

## Quick Setup

1. Open the **.env.template** file and make changes to this section. Make sure none of the ports you choose are already in use on the local machine. Even if you are not using all of these features, it is easiest (although you can just remove them) to change them to something innocuous and move on.


## Tech Stack
- **OS:** Ubuntu (containerized)
- **Languages:** PHP, Node.js
- **Databases:** MariaDB, Redis
- **IDE Support:** XDebug, VS Code (via DevContainer)

## Build and Load Expectations
The initial build process **can take a significant amount of time** if there are no cached images or common layers available. The actual time required will vary depending on hardware performance:
- **First-time build (no cache):** ~250 seconds
- **Rebuilding after deleting containers:** ~60 seconds
- **Starting containers of an existing environment:** ~6 seconds

Once the initial build is complete, subsequent starts are much faster, making this a **lightweight and efficient development workflow**.
